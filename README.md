# Atlantic Herring MHC Class II Diversity

This repository contains scripts and resources associated with the study:

**Unheralded high MHC Class II polymorphism in the abundant Atlantic herring resolved by long-read sequencing**  now available on bioRxiv with doi - 10.1101/2025.06.08.658498v1

## ðŸ“œ Overview

This study characterizes the extraordinary diversity of MHC Class II genes in Atlantic herring (*Clupea harengus*) using long-read PacBio HiFi sequencing data from 14 individuals across three geographic regions (Celtic Sea, Baltic Sea, and Norwegian Sea) along with the reference genome assembly (Ch_v2.0.2v2). By analyzing phased haplotype assemblies, we uncover:

- **Nine MHC Class II loci** distributed across four chromosomes
- Two distinct gene lineages: **DA (polymorphic)** and **DB (non-polymorphic)** and a total of 195 DAA, 220 DAB, 53 DBA, and 107 DBB sequences
- Extensive **copy number variation** and **divergent allelic supertypes**
- Strong **positive selection** in exon 2, encoding the peptide-binding region, as well as **high dN and dS than human counterparts**
- non-random association of alpha-beta genes pairs, indicating **co-evolution of alpha-beta gene pairs**
- **haplotype diversity** maintained by divergent supertypes

This work sets a new benchmark for understanding vertebrate MHC gene diversity.

## ðŸ”¬ Project Goals

- Identify and annotate MHC Class II genes across haplotype assemblies
- Measure nucleotide and amino acid diversity (Ï€, dN/dS)
- Model MHC Class II protein structure and peptide-binding residues
- Group alleles into supertypes and assess their co-segregation
- Provide reproducible scripts and workflows for the above analyses
